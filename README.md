# cli menu demo

This code demonstrates the use of the module to create a clickable menu in the terminal.
Due to the nature of the module, this code only works on Linux.
The media player for cli mpv is used for the demonstration. The menu is created from playlists or directory scans for later playback.

Requires a library to be installed for operation:
`pip install simple-term-menu`

as well as the mpv media player:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install mpv`
